/**
 * The base test for the authenticated suite. An auto fixture resets the database
 * to a clean slate (maps only) before each test via the e2e-only reset endpoint,
 * so no test ever sees another test's maps (ADR-0009). The reset keeps users and
 * sessions, so the shared login from `auth.setup.ts` survives it.
 *
 * This is a fixture, not a top-level `beforeEach`: a shared module is evaluated
 * once, so a top-level hook would register against only the first importer's
 * suite — an auto fixture runs per test regardless.
 *
 * The reset POST is intentionally unauthenticated and relies on `TestController`
 * having no guard, so it works even for the logged-out auth journey.
